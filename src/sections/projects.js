        As technical responsible I was in lead of a project with ca. 10
        developers (frontend and backend). The goal of the project was
        implementing a redesign of main portal of Swiss Post. My main
        responsibilities were: specification of requirements, management and
        contact with stakeholders, sprint planning, leading overall architecture
        process, as well as reviewing the code. The Portal is a main information
        source for clients of Swiss Post, as it covers a vast portfolio of
        services the Swiss Post offers. It also provides navigation script for
        all online applications of Swiss Post.

        I shaped a "microsites" framework of Swiss Post significantly, being
        it's developer since the beginning. The framework allows Swiss Post to
        launch new small sites in no time, without losing the flexibility to
        give an own character to every so called "microsite". From 2017 till
        2018 I was technically responsible for the product, leading a team of
        3-5 developers.

        Being the main information platform of Swiss Post, the portal of Swiss
        Post needs continous improvements. Since 2016 I worked on the release
        management of the portal as a developer. In early 2017 I became a
        technical responsible person for topics of Marketing Automation and
        Analytics. Eventually I became technically reponsible for the whole
        platform.

        I desinged and developed new frontend for orienteering Live-Results

        T-Pak is an online training diary for all Swiss orienteers. It was built
        in 2003 in PHP and has since then collected a big amount of technical
        debts. I was asked to work on the second and last attempt to rebuild
        this complex application, keeping an old database, but rewriting the
        code from scratch. I had a core part in the conception process,
        implemeneted the analysis part and was responsible for the
        infrastructure. I also reviewed the code of my co-developer.
